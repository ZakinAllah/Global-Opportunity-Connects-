            <h3>2. How do blockchain and cryptocurrency work?</h3>
            <p>
                Blockchain technology is essentially a distributed ledger system where transactions are recorded in blocks and added in chronological order. Each block is cryptographically secured, and all participants in the network (nodes) have access to the same copy of the ledger, making it secure and transparent.<br><br>
                Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that operates on blockchain technology. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum aren’t controlled by any central authority like a government or bank. Blockchain ensures every transaction is verified and recorded, preventing double-spending and fraud.<br><br>
                <strong>Uses</strong>: Blockchain has applications in supply chain management (tracking goods), smart contracts (self-executing contracts), and decentralized finance (DeFi).
